# Sudoku Solver

A powerful and efficient *Sudoku Solver* built in *JAVA*, designed to solve any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This project demonstrates advanced problem-solving techniques, showcasing logic, recursion, and backtracking.

## 🌟 Features
- *Efficient Algorithm*: Uses backtracking to fill in numbers and solve puzzles accurately and efficiently.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Simple code structure for easy navigation and understanding.
- *Multiple Puzzle Support*: Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
- *Extensive Documentation*: Clear comments and explanations within the code for learners and developers.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- *JAVA*: Core programming language
- *Data Structures and Algorithms*: Focus on recursion and backtracking

## 🔍 How It Works
This solver uses a backtracking algorithm that:
1. *Scans* for empty cells.
2. *Tries* placing numbers 1 through 9.
3. *Checks* if the number placement is valid within the row, column, and 3x3 grid.
4. *Recursively* continues until the puzzle is solved.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- *GUI Interface*: Add a graphical user interface to allow users to input puzzles more easily.
- *Optimized Algorithms*: Experiment with alternative algorithms to enhance performance and reduce solve time.
